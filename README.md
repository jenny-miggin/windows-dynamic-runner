# windows-dynamic-runner

There are 3 branches here.

* Main: just a basic implementation of the path filtering orb
* merge-all-config: Merges config files listed in .circleci/modular-config-list-main.txt
* selectively-merge-configs: This gets super complex, so I'll defer to Makoto's notes [here](https://github.com/circle-makotom/circle-select-split-config#behind-the-scene)
